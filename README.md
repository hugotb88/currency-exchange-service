# How to Register a microservice in Eureka
- in the POM of the microservice project add the dependency for Eureka client
```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```
Additional, just to be sure, you can add the following to the properties file
``eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone = http://localhost:8761/eureka``

#Client Side load balancing with Feign using spring-cloud-loadbalancer
- Is included in Eureka client dependency when you uses Feign Clients
- In old versions of Spring Cloud was called Ribbon
- The to implement it is removing the URL from the Feign
    - Then If there is more than one instance of the microservice running, the Spring Clouyd Load Balancer will check with Eureka the number of instances and will balance the load of requests.
